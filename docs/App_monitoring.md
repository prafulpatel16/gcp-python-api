## ðŸŽ¯ Objective of Uptime Check

The Uptime Check helps ensure your app is online and responsive by:

- âœ… Periodically sending HTTP(S) requests (e.g. every 60 seconds)
- âœ… Validating HTTP response code (expected: `200 OK`)
- âœ… Measuring latency and availability
- âœ… Triggering alerts if the app fails from any region

---

## âœ… 1. Enable Cloud Logging

**Cloud Run automatically enables Cloud Logging** if the following conditions are met:

- Deployment is done via `gcloud run deploy` or Google Cloud Console
- Your app logs to `stdout` or `stderr` using Pythonâ€™s `print()` or `logging` modules
